# Basketball coach Phil Jackson says that in order for an NBA
# team to be a contender for a championship, they need to win
# 40 games before they lose 20 games.

# Function is_a_contender takes three parameters: 
# team name (string)
# number of wins (integer)
# number of losses (integer)

# Returns one of three strings:

# - If the team is a contender (at least 40 wins and fewer than 20 losses), return "The [team name] are a contender!"
# - If the team is not a contender (less than 40 wins and at least 20 losses), return "The [team name] are not a contender!"
# - If it cannot be determined (both values are higher or both values are lower), return "The [team name] might be a contender!"
