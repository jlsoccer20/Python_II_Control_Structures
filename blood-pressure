# Consult this blood pressures chart: http://bit.ly/2CloACs

# Function check_blood_pressure takes two parameters: 
# a systolic blood pressure and a diastolic blood pressure

# Returns "Low", "Ideal", "Pre-high", or "High" 
# -- whichever corresponds to the given systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

# If a combined blood pressure is on the line between two categories (e.g. 80 and 60, or 120 and 70),
# result is the higher category (e.g. Ideal and Pre-high for those two combinations).

def check_blood_pressure(systolic_bp, diastolic_bp):
    # Check for High first, since we want to return the higher category if on the border
    if systolic_bp >= 140 or diastolic_bp >= 90:
        return "High"
    elif systolic_bp >= 120 or diastolic_bp >= 80:
        return "Pre-high"
    elif systolic_bp >= 90 or diastolic_bp >= 60:
        return "Ideal"
    else:
        return "Low"

# Ideal
test_systolic = 110
test_diastolic = 70
